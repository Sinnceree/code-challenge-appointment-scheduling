## Challenge
Barebone application based on the requirements in the email.

The landing page shows a list of users created with the option to generate new users (random user api) that sends the data to Firestore and keeps it. 

We can create appointments with the users and supply info like name, number, and description, alongside the date.

On the list appointment page, we can see that specific UUID appoints and can control if they want to accept/deny it.

# This is not a polish application mearly done in a few hours to have basic of it shown.
